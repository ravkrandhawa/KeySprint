# KeySprint

* The idea for KeySprint was born out of a deeply personal experience. My immigrant mother, while applying for jobs in Canada, faced immense challenges with typing speed requirements, as she hadnâ€™t been exposed to technology in her home country. Watching her struggle with traditional typing tests, which felt disengaging and uninspiring, sparked a realization: typing tests could be so much more than just monotonous exercises. I wanted to create a tool that makes improving typing skills enjoyable and engaging. With competitive features like racing against AI and the ability to customize fonts, KeySprint transforms the typing experience into something fun, interactive, and motivating!
